Hi [r/MMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/), by request i have put together this post as a resource for information on PEDs in MMA. I am a pharmaceutical scientist and also a couple months from obtaining my postgraduate MD, and have been an avid MMA fan since 2005.

Now, this post will have a few sections:

- What are PEDs?

- How can athletes use PEDs without being caught?

- How do undetectable PEDs get created?

- Bonus: Which PEDs are best for MMA?

#### 1) First up, what are PEDs?

As the name suggests, PEDs are simply performance enhancing drugs. These can vary significantly in mechanism of action, but they all provide an advantage to the athlete in their sport one way or another. For example, beta blockers - eg propranolol - are banned in competition for shooters, because by acting as an antagonist at b1 receptors they reduce sympathetic activity at the heart, resulting in a slower heartrate and a calmer physical disposition, which can benefit a shooter's aim in competition.

For MMA there are many different types of PEDs, for example:

**To benefit cardiovascular endurance,** there is EPO, EPO analogues, other EPO receptor agonists, and unique compounds like SR9009 and GW1516 aka cardarine/endurobol.

**To benefit healing and recovery**, there is BPC157, ibutamoren, IGF1, and endless other compounds which boost IGF1 in some way or another.(Very, very bad to take if you happen to have a hidden cancer... let's just say dialing cell growth up can ramp up things other than just recovery.)

**To benefit reaction times** and cognitive processing there is piracetam, phenylpiracetam, and semax among many others.

**To benefit weight cutting**, any compounds which decrease body fat/Increase lean body mass without adding fat will be of benefit. Muscle cells can gain and lose water far more easily than fat cells. This is why DC and other fatties, as well as some women (naturally higher bf%) often struggle to make weight, whilst juicy juice boys can be 30lbs heavier on fight night than weigh-ins.

#### 2) How to use PEDs undetected

Here are some of the methods that I know of; some of these are still effective today, some have been updated and modified in order to remain efficacious, and some have been rendered completely ineffective by updates in modern testing procedures and protocols. None are infallible and many of them are only designed to beat specific test conditions, eg Cycling off will only work if the test date is known well in advance.

**Microdosing:** If you know when the test is scheduled, you can use frequent small doses of short acting PEDs which will be cleared from your system quickly should you be notified of an imprending test. (If caught by surprise, simply delaying a couple hours may suffice eg aldo repeatedly spilling his sample in brazil, other fighters being unreachable for a few hours when informed usada is looking for them etc)

**Cycling off** - Hop on and then hop off in time for everything to leave your system before test date.

**novel compounds** - If you use a PED that usada doesn't know exists, they can't pop you for it. It's really that simple. See below for more info

#### 3) How do novel PEDs get made?

Most people overestimate the difficulty of getting a Chinese lab to synthesise you a kg or so of quite literally any compound you require of them. All you need is a name, maybe a structure if you're thorough, and the $ to pay for it.

Example off the top of my head:

Turinabol, an androgenic steroid Jones popped for, is known by the chemical name **4-chloro**-17β-hydroxy17α-methylandrosta-1,4-dien-3-one.

As of a couple years ago at least, I could just jump on alibaba, find a Chinese lab making hormone products, and msg them to ask if they could synthesise me a kg of, say for example, **8-chloro**-17β-hydroxy17α-methylandrosta-1,4-dien-3-one. See the 8-chloro instead of the original 4-chloro? This small change makes this molecule an entirely different compound from the original, in regards to both drug-testing and in terms of the law - but as long as that change doesn't affect the way it binds to its receptor, then by-and-large it's physiological effects will remain the same. **This is the key principle underlying the fact that so many athletes in so many sports can clearly be doping, and yet never fail a drug test**

I mean, maybe its not the chlorine position change specifically that works, but as an athlete's chemist, in extremely simplified terms, to find a novel compound you could just look up the binding sites of Turinabol, (identifiable via [xray crystallography](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography)) and then pick a non-binding group to change the position of. So, say in the above example, if the first chlorine was indeed non-binding i might change it from position 4 to position 8 like i did above. Then I could test this new compound on some brave Guinea pigs and then take samples of those people's blood and piss to run through the known USADA testing panels and see if any metabolites trigger a positive.

In reality this has process has been done decades ago by other chemists and then refined and developed by a long line of scientists and athletes since, and I'm sure there's a long list of well and lesser known compound analogues floating around out there somewhere that have long been known to be outside of testing agencies awareness.

Chemists/doctors today can also search the old pharmaceutical patents and development papers to find older unknown compounds which can be modified, and then test them on people and run the resulting blood and piss samples through HPLC (High-performance liquid chromatography) - think mass spectrometry etc - to identify any metabolites which could show up in a tester's assays. This ensures neither the parent compound nor its metabolites will be detectable by testers.

One famous example was ['The Clear'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrogestrinone), a novel compound made by a scientist who searched the literature for obscure anabolic agents and then just tweaked one slightly, tested it and found it worked, then never published this info. Until somebody ended up giving a sample of 'The clear' to WADA chemists decades later, any athlete could use The Clear as much as they liked without any fear of discovery. This is because **testing for a compound which you don't have a control sample of is essentially impossible**, and will remain impossible unless you can somehow get a sample of said compound. Today, sports labs can do this same process to find novel PEDs, then not publish or patent their findings, establishing essentially an *unlimited supply of a completely undetectable drug* for their own athletes forever.

#### 4 Which PEDs are best?

It's my personal opinion that PEDs which help with cardio are the most beneficial in MMA. Cardio is imo one of, if not the most powerful weapon in mma. It's key for speed. It's key for maintaining power as a fight goes on. You need it for offense. You need it for defense. It helps wrestling. It helps striking. It fucking helps your chin for Christ's sake - think of the cardio machines you know; Holloway, Colby, Diaz, Volk. Cardio is king, imo. And don't be fooled into thinking a pill can give cardio. It must be trained - hard. Supplements are just that; for supplementing.

Cardiovascular performance can be supplemented legally, as in altitude training/tent sleeping, or illegally as in blood doping, or using PEDs like EPO, the many EPO analogues and secretagogues, as well as compounds like SR9009 and Cardarine/Endurobol.

For any who dont know, ['Blood doping'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping) is when you withdraw your whole blood, centrifuge, collect RBCs only, refrigerate, then return that RBC concentrate to your body a month later once your bone marrow has replaced the blood you originally removed. Yes, that is literally just shoving extra RBCs into ur bloodstream lol, and not only is it extremely effective but is extraordinarily difficult to detect, since it's your own blood cells. Just ask Lance Armstrong.

However one thing about increased Haematocrit is that the higher you are, the less beneficial it is. Because with no oxygen in the air, all the Red Blood Cells in the world won't help at all. But with more oxygen in the air, the more the increased carriers of that oxygen can be utilised. Basically, the benefits of altitude training and EPO receptor agonists is maximised at sea level and minimised with increasing altitude.

**Fun fact:** that increased percentage of RBCs (Aka red blood cells aka erythrocytes) as a component of your blood in turn means less room for the far more viscous plasma, which means thicker blood, which is why dopers in the old tour de France races would wear heart monitors at night whilst they slept, to go off if their heart rate dropped too low - because with blood as thick and saturated with RBCs as theirs, clots can easily form. (And did, killing more than one cyclist.) Once awoken by their alarms, they would jump onto a stationary bike to bring their heart rate up and increase the flow of blood around the body, thus reducing the task of clots.

This is also perhaps (head canon for me personally) why TJ Dillashaw had to shadow box on a luggage conveyor belt in public [that utterly cringeworthy time.](https://imgur.com/m1BDWul) Blood thick from EPO + long time spent stationary on a plane + athlete with low HR = massively increased risk of DVT(deep vein thrombisis, aka clot in ya leg veins) or PE(pulmonary embolism, clot in ya lung vessels). By bringing his HR up by shadow boxing asap after disembarking from the plane, he ensures that his circulation doesnt remain slow and thick and prone to clotting. Same reason you're told to flex your feet and calves on long flights to get the blood flowing and avoid getting clots in your legs. (DVTs)

#### By request: UFC 182 Analysis:

NOTE: If you haven't read [my initial post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/x1wjhi/peds_in_mma/) then please do, as together each post should hopefully add to the understanding of the other.

Firstly, to help your understanding i have spent some time and organised the [publicly available bloodwork results](https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/1/23/7880561/official-documents-from-jon-jones-daniel-cormier-ufc-182-drug-test) into these [far more easily interpreted tables](https://imgur.com/a/gR3ujfm)

In men, hormones are regulated by whats called the **HPG Axis**. This stands for the Hypothalamic - Pituitary - Gonadal axis. [Here's a picture if it helps](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Archisman-Mahapatra/publication/350037153/figure/fig3/AS:1000797542309890@1615620136936/Regulation-of-HPG-axis.ppm) This axis works like this: The hypothalamus secretes GnRH, the GnRH acts on the pituitary to secrete Leutenising Hormone aka LH, the LH enters circulation and acts on the Leydig cells of the testes which in turn causes them to release testosterone. LH levels are pretty steady in men; rising slightly with age but otherwise remaining quite stable. [Here's a table showing LH, FSH, and LH/FSH by age and gender.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRBhGRTvMSVa7lEpgwDODX2l3gbiofN50Y1Gg&usqp=CAU)

So without further ado, let's dive in! I highly suggest opening [This table from earlier](https://imgur.com/a/gR3ujfm) as well as [this album of research data](https://imgur.com/a/ySxxuNw) in new tabs, so that you can follow as I go through everything.

To start with, let's establish the normal range for urinary LH in mIU/ml in healthy adult men, so that we can compare to DC and JJs results and see if theyre normal. The reason i think LH is such a good marker is because it is a part of a normally functioning sex hormone axis, so even if an athlete was using novel & undetectable compounds, LH would affected due to any exogenous androgens having a negative feedback effect on LH secretion.

Now that we've established that, let's get analysing! In Fig 1, we can see that the average LH level in the 266 healthy men studied is around 2.4. In other studies i found, the normal range was about 1-10, and correlated strongly with normal testosterone production in the testes (Fig 2).

Now, before we go any further, I'd like to note something important: Most research dealing with LH levels is dealing with *serum* LH, that is, LH levels in the blood. As you'll note however, the lab which tested these fighters - the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory aka SMRTL - is measuring the *urinary* LH concentrations. In order to better understand the relationship between *serum* lh and *urinary* lh, I had to delve deep into medical endocrinology journals, and luckily was able to find what I was looking for. The most helpful study that I found was looking into less-invasive methods of testing for hypogonadism and delayed puberty; you can check it out [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477746/) however access to the full text will require payment or a university login; luckily however I've put the most relevant graph as Fig 3 in the album. This graph matches other studies I found, and shows a strong correlation between urinary LH and serum LH, determined by the equation: Urinary LH =0.37 + 1.63 times the Serum LH (r = 0.885,P , 0.001). Simplified, we can confidently apply this relationship to our aforementioned normal range in serum, to get a normal urinary LH range of approx 2 - 17 mIU/ml.

Fig 1 is taken from [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15476527/) which also explains the following in regards to the results shown:

> The upper limit of the present calculated normal range for LH (7.0 IU/L) is lower than that of published ranges. Moreover, the present range is much narrower than published ranges, presumably because the 266 subjects were uniformly fit, with few extremes of body proportions, as judged by the BMI. LH is secreted in a pulsatile fashion, and fluctuates more than does testosterone; in clinical practice it is recommended that three blood samples be drawn ª20 min apart, and pooled before assay [5,17,18]. The present narrow normal range is therefore the more striking, as it was based on single samples at each time point. Ranges derived from pooled samples would be expected to be even narrower.

What does this mean? basically, LH levels vary throughout the day however even with this variation, amongst 266 fit and healthy men their serum LH ranges always remained within the range of 0.7 to 7 mIU/ml. Converting serum values to urinary using the formula we derived above, we can say that even with diurnal variation, **urinary LH in normal, healthy men does not generally exceed the range of 1.5 to 12 mIU/ml.**

Now, with that established, let's look at DC & JJ's bloodwork. I've put each fighter's comparison to the prior-established normal ranges in quotes, just to help readability.

......

> Not only does DC have an LH level of 46!!, but that level then drops down to 7.5 in the 2 weeks between Dec 17 and Jan 3. Considering that we established before that daily variations never exceed approx 10 mIU/ml, and only vary by ~0.1% as we get older each year, having a 40 mIU/ml swing in 2 weeks is....not normal. Variations in sample specific gravity (aka concentration aka hydration levels) can account for part of this, but by no means can it explain all of it.

.

> Moving onto JJ, we see him go from 16 to 3.4 in that same period. Urine concentration and time of day could actually account for this, however nothing would explain his first measurement of 0.5 mIU/ml LH - at that level, no un-enhanced person would be functioning properly, let alone able to complete a tough training camp.

Now lets establish a normal range for testosterone - Figs 4 and 5 show a helpful breakdown of testosterone ranges in the same units as our ufc 182 bloodwork. Fig 1 however is ultimately a better study IMO, as it accounts for time-of-day variations. Looking back at fig 1 then, we can see that with those variations, men under age 40 varied between 1.86 and 11.18 ug/L. Since ug/L is the same as ng/ml, we can say that in normal men under age 40 and accounting even for intra-day variations, testosterone generally remained in the range of 2-11 ng/ml. Figure 5 shows a broader range - 6.2 to 29.0 ng/ml; likely as the study accounted for fewer variables. Nonetheless let's be generous and use the most extreme values from each study to compare to our old friends JJ & DC. We'll say that the **normal testosterone range is approx 2-29 ng/ml**

> DC's test levels vary between 70 and 7.1; far greater than we'd normally expect. In addition, 70ng/ml is a huge value for someone in their late 30s who is 2weeks out from a fight at LHW and is very likely in the final stages of losing a large amount of fat. (something that normally crashes testosterone in healthy men)

.

> JJ on the other hand ranges from 0.5ng/ml (roflmao) to 16ng/ml, averaging about 5ng/ml. You don't need me to tell you what's wrong with that. We can also notice that since our urinary LH range is 1.5 to 12mIU/ml, and our testosterone range is 2-11ng/ml, we should expect the T/LH ratio in these units to at least somewhat approximate ~1. DC however gets as high as 1.73 T/LH ratio, and JJ gets as low as 0.31.

Finally, Fig 6 shows the urinary concentrations of Etiocholanone and Androsterone in young (25-31) and older (68-70) men. This graphs shows us that **Andro levels range from** 1.7 to 3.7 ug/ml, or **1700 to 3700 ng/ml.** **Etio levels on the other hand range from** 4 to 8.5ug/ml, which equates to **4000 - 8500 ng/ml.**

> Dc's Andro levels go from 5900 to 750 in the space of 2 weeks - impressively out of range for both the upper and lower limits. *Nice*. His Etio levels on the other hand go from 5100 to 590, only breaching the lower range.

> JJ comparatively has Andro Levels that vary from 55 (rofl!) to 890; never coming close to the lower limit of 1700 in the study cited. His Etio levels by contrast go from 120 (bahaha) to 2000, again not even coming close to the lower limit.

.

Now I've already spent far too long doing this post, (it has been fun tho) and im sure i haven't been able to avoid making mistakes at some point. When it comes to making a conclusion however I will leave that up to you, the audience. The only insight I will offer here is that these results could potentially ( ;) )suggest that DC & JJ are both taking PEDs but are approaching it in two contrasting ways: (*Note: lots of conjecture here on my part**)

.

**DC may be supplementing with either LH or an LH analogue/secretagogue, which would account for his huge LH numbers and corresponding high Testosterone as well as explain the consistent relationship between his Etio, Andro, Test and LH values. It suggests to me that there is likely some supplementation going on, but that this supplementation occurs either downstream or at the level of the pituitary gland - for example, an LH secretagogue which stimulates overproduction of LH by the pituitary and a corresponding rise in Testosterone levels (and their metabolites).**

.

**JJ on the other hand is suppressed as fuck; his bloods show suppressed LH, low testosterone, and low testosterone metabolites. His HPG (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadotropin) axis is completely suppressed, suggesting to me that he's likely taking some form of novel, unknown-and-untestable-by-USADA compoud, which is acting on his androgen receptors and causing negative feedback right up his HPG axis.**

That's it, i'm exhausted, I'll have to come back and fix up the undoubted numerous typos and other mistakes, but for now, I really have to get back to my own study.

If you made it this far I hope you've learned something, Take care and goodnight :)

I just watched all of MPMDs vids on Jones. My thoughts:

He's got a decent understanding of things, but he never mentions andro, etio, or LH - only focussing on test and test/epitest ratios. He also neglects to mention the large role that urine specific gravity plays in interpreting any urinary levels, nor the differences between serum and urinary hormones. He does come to the exact same conclusion as I did re: his undetectable gear being tainted with tbol, which is impressive if he has no formal medical education.

Regardless of my nitpicking, it pained me to realise someone had already pretty much made the same analysis that I had, and in retrospect I wish I had been asked to look at a different fighters results so that I could bring something new to the table.

Perhaps one day I'll remedy this by looking over some far more trusted athletes results - **if anyone knows where to find bloodwork for Wonderboy, Moreno, demeterious Johnson, khabib or other fighters that many assume are clean, hook me up - it'd be amusing to glance over them and see what they look like**. Now that most of the work is done in this post, checking a fighters bloodwork from this point on should be a relatively trivial affair.

It depends what you need. If you’re not drug tested and you retain boat loads of water from 500mg test, then I’d surmise the best pairs for you are probably

1. test + EQ 250 each and adjust as needed. Although, adjusting dose of EQ takes a very long time to determine. I’d suggest this pair because EQ boosts rbc and hemoglobin more so than testosterone does. But if you’re Hgb is already 17ish then I’d skip EQ because it probably wouldn’t provide you much actual benefit and might actually send your hemoglobin dangerously high.

2. test + masteron. Again, 250 each and adjust as needed. Masteron would give you additional anabolic milligrams, provide no additional water retention (or essentially none) and has a positive affect on strength with minimal change in body weight.

You could also get some long-term benefit from HGH use in terms of making more injury resilience, but this is a very long-term adaptation from HGH use.

Also, 250 mg of testosterone is absolutely NOT TRT dosing. TRT dosing is more along the lines of 75-100 mg a week for a 200 pound guy.

Also, if you retain that much fluid from testosterone then I would stay away from nandrolone. Nandrolone is generally more water retentive than testosterone.

---

I've fought in the cage best on either of these combos: test + tbol, test + eq + tbol. I really like tbol for mma due to the increase in cardio, explosiveness and speed. My overhand right feels like a guided missile strike, and when you combine it with EQ, it's pretty insane.

For the record, this is just me personally. I have over 30 fights in the cage/ring. I LOVE tbol, but I have to be honest and say many of my teammates have not liked it. Some considered it mild. To me, it's always been amazing and I really feel the impact of my shots...even ones blocked by their guard, I can physically feel myself battering them back in a way I don't do while natty.

Second, bloat: try lowering salt intake for a week, see what it says. If nothing, lower carb intake, see what it says if nothing, lower test to 250mg. If bloat is gone, try using a different esther (enanthate makes some people bloated).

Best gear: low dose anavar (20-30mg) before gym, 3-4x weekly. Tbol and oxy, are fun to play around with, but in general, stay away from orals if you don't need them. Don't use HGH, it's only side effects and there's no reason on earth to use it.

I'd opt for: low dose test (any esther that doesn't make you bloated), nothing else is needed if you're not competing on F2W or mundials.

---

Tbol gives you crazy endurance without changing your Hematocrit or making you hold water Also, you could consider Primobolan instead of EQ. Your EQ is OK (not spoiled), but Primo holds less water EPO + GH is a game changer if you are getting tested. EPO works through the same pathway as EQ or Primo on endurance, but you dont mess with your hormones. Low dose GH wont bloat you but helps a lot for recovery

---

I have used peds doing combats sports and I agree high testosterone is awful. I didn’t like eq either. My favorite stack was something like 100mg testosterone per week with 100mg masteron e or primobolan e. It’s just enough of that edge that you want without the extra weight and sides.

You pinning w/the same needle you’re using to fill the syringe? If so, then it would hurt a little bc that dulls the needle a little. I always use a new, fresh needle so it’s really sharp. Make sure you’re putting it in straight. After you inject, leave it in for like 10 seconds then gently take it out. Other than maybe a little spot of blood some times. Should be smooth
