As usual I'm busy when compound experience threads pop up so I type quickly and tend to leave things out, ask away if you have questions, they're most welcomed.

Masteron is included in all my blasts nowadays. 300-500 mg are good to improve mood, size gains and to keep me sane on 19nors (ment and Deca so far, haven't used tren)

I've only used enanthate.

Vascularity and hardness are the most noticeable visual effects, while the strength/activation games are what I value the most.

It definitely has E2 control properties, i don't support the idea it only masks the effects of estrogen. Tanking E2 never happened to me, but my body loves making it so nowadays my blasts are TRT test + a 19nor and mast like 300-500 mg each (I'm sitting on 100ml of primo at 150mg but haven't used it yet). These days I'm blasting 75 test, 300 deca and 500 mast just fine. Deca does aromatise at 20% the rate compared to test, and without it I'd probably would be considering adding some low dose AI once a week. All good with mast. If it goes too low I'll just add some test.

Dave Crosland explained pretty well that Masteron (or proviron) are the best prevention against deca dick, other than keeping e2 low. So this is a thing to consider when blasting 19nors.

Hmm what else...

**If I'm experiencing acne (which means e2 is on the high side) I've noticed it subsides with the addition of mast.**

**Mood is amazing. Somedays libido is too high but let's be real, there's no such thing.**

Side effects: honestly, none so far. Prostate is good (i also use cialis at 5mg for prostate prevention so there's that). I was buzzing my head well before using gear so can't say about hair. I'm pretty sure I've gained body hair but i don't know if i should blame masteron or ment for that.

**BP is fine (ranging 110-120/60-70), while with other oral DHTs gets messy fast.**

Except for periods where i am on TRT only (usually after blasts) I usually take some 75mg of mast along with it. It just makes everything better. Will try to substitute with primo after this blast is done.

**HDL/LDL values were always fucky regardless of masteron, but since I've added red yeast rice pills to my supplementation routine it's perfect.**

Ahhh yes. Used Mast for 12 weeks after 16 weeks on 500mg Test (first cycle). At the 16 week mark, bloods still looked pretty solid. Everything in range except ALT and HDL a few points low. But to be fair, my HDL has always hovered around 35-40 even as a natural. Will likely address this with meds in the future if I cant get it higher with diet and cruising. Onto the meat or the subject.

At 16 weeks, dropped my test dose to 350mg per week and added in mast prop @ 350mg per week - titrated up to about 525mg per week for the last 4 weeks. Also, Adjusted my calories so I was about 500 under maintenance - 1000 under on rest days. This combination was fucking awesome. Weight dropped from 235ish back down to 220 in this period, but I looked great.

**Pros: Full muscles even in a deficit**

**Minor strength increase all across the board**

**Vascularity - lots of it. Had some insane chest veins that I've never seen before**

**Muscles always felt hard and pumped, even at rest**

**Better mood and general drive/motivation.**

**much better libido**

**Diamond erections**

**CONS: Prostate felt a lil swollen towards the end; minor urinary issues (hesitation)**

**Skin would be super oily AND super dry, resulting in some increased blackheads and whiteheads. Thankfully I don't get true acne.**

**Blood pressure increase into 140s/90s (likely a result of E2 management mentioned below)**

**HDL went into the toilet (12), and LDL went up quite a bit. EDIT E2 was also on the higher side (92) but I didn't notice any estrogen sides so I wasn't using an AI or SERM, which seems to support Masterson's ability to mask E2 sides**

Overall: A really nice compound. Definitely helped me keep muscle size and strength while in a deficit. Great libido and erection quality. In a good mood every day despite having lots of external stressors. Lipids take a hit but that's somewhat expected. Mast pretty much lives up to the expectations and is fun to use - gives a nice look. Will use again in the future.
